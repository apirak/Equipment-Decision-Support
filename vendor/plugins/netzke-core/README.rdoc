= netzke-core
Create Ext JS + Rails reusable components (widgets) with minimum effort.

This is the bare bones of the Netzke framework. Use it to build your own widgets from scratch. For pre-built widgets (like panels, grids, forms, trees, applications), see the netzke-basepack (http://github.com/skozlov/netzke-basepack) project.

The idea behind the Netzke framework is that it allows you write reusable client/server code. Create a widget, and then embed it (or load it dynamically) into your Ext-based applications or HTML pages. For more info, see the links below.

== Instalation
For the latest ("edge") stuff, install as plugin (recommended!):

    ./script/plugin install git://github.com/skozlov/netzke-core.git

Otherwise, install as gem:

    gem install netzke-core
    
To generate the migrations for Netzke persistent storage (if you want to use it):

    ./script/generate netzke_core

Netzke assumes that your ExtJS library is in public/extjs (which may be a symbolic link).

== Usage
Here's how to embed a Netzke widget into your Rails view.

1. In your layout, within the "head" tag, use the <tt>netzke_init</tt> helper to include all the necessary JavaScript and styles. 

    <%= netzke_init %>
    
2. In config/routes.rb declare the Netzke routes:

    map.netzke
    
3. In your view use the <tt>netzke</tt> helper wherever you want to insert a widget.

    <%= netzke :grid_panel, :model => "User", :columns => [:id, :name, :created_at] %>
    
(here we use the GridPanel widget from the netzke-basepack project)

== Running in production

1. There is some basic JS minification when running in production. This uses JSMin to strip comments, whitespace etc.

It can also manually configured by setting :minify_js

Netzke::Base.configure :minify_js=>true
